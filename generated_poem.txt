**Fading pixel skies,**   *Digital dusk—wiring veins.*
**Ghosts hum rust's lullaby.**    **Silicon hearts wilt**
*Beneath the electric frost—*   **Forgotten keystrokes
weep.**    *Haiku 1*   - *Imagery*: "pixel skies," "wiring
veins," "ghosts," "rust" evoke digital decay.   -
*Metaphor*: Tech as a living entity ("wiring veins,"
"silicon hearts").   - *Personification*: Ghosts "hum,"
keystrokes "weep."   - *Rhythm*: Broken lines mimic
glitching technology.    *Haiku 2*   - *Simile*-adjacent:
Frost parallels emotional coldness.   - *Sound*: Internal
rhyme ("frost"/"lost" implied).   - *Mood*: Desolate, hollow
progress.    *Both use natural pauses between lines to
mirror disconnect*.
